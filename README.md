With this Employee Directory, managers and employees can:
- View data about other employees, such as name, location, email, and phone number
- Sort the table by the employee's last name
- Filter the users by the employee's first or last name

Using React, the application manages component state, separates the UI into components, and responds to user events for quick access to employee information.

## Installation
Use the following command for installation in the root and /src folders:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
The application will be invoked by running from /employee-directory/src:
```bash
npm start
```
