## Description
For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:
- Sort the table by at least one category
- Filter the users by at least one property.

## Installation
Use the following command for installation:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
The application will be invoked by running:
```bash
npm start
```
